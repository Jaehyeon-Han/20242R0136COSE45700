Goal: Create a vector graphic editor with design patterns applied.

# Functional Requirements
1. Objects
   - Types: Lines(straight, free), shapes(rectangle, triangle, ellipse, etc), image, text
   - Properties: Width/height, position, z-order
   - Can be multiselected with Ctrl + Left-click.
   - Can be resized with mouse-drag.
2. Property Window
   - Shows the properties of selected object. (none if not selected, what about multi-selected case?)
   - Properties on window should be synchronized with the objects.
3. Design Patterns
  - Abstract Factory
  - Singleton
  - â˜… Composite: 
  - State
  - Command
  - Observer
  - Decorator

# Current Plans
1. Create a minimum viable product with a simple class design.
   1. Research if there's a vector graphics tool in Java.
