# Goals
- [x] Study the basics of SVG format in xml to get a better idea of how to design classes.
- [ ] Check out Java libraries for vector graphics and read the documents on how to use.
- [x] Narrow down the requirements to build an MVP.

# Requirements for MVP
1. Can draw lines with mouse clicks.
2. Can erase all.
3. Show properties of the object in a box when selected.
4. Can change properties in another boxes.

### Basic Shapes
Reference point(usually top-left) and the geometric properties(width/height for a rectangle, center coordinate and radius for a circle) of shapes are needed to define shapes in a frame.  
Some other attributes are colors(fill), border(stroke, stroke-width).
   0. Path: M - Mark a new initial point, L - Draw a line to the new point, Z - Indicate the end of the path
   1. Rect: x, y, width, height
   2. Circle: cx, cy, r
   3. Ellipse: cw, cy, rx, ry
   4. (straight) Line: x1, y1, x2, y2
   5. Polyline: points(set of x, y)
   6. Polygon: points(set of x, y), polyline + z
### Text
Just using <text></text> is enough in most times.
### Image
href attribute to define the source, width/height to set the size.

## How it is related to the requirements of the projects
1. Types: Lines(straight, free), shapes(rectangle, triangle, ellipse, etc), image, text
   - Related Tags: Basic Shape & Path, text, image(with href property)
1. Properties: Width/height, position, z-order, color
   - Size(width/height): Automatically defined by the points in path or geometric properties of basic shapes
   - Position: x, y properties
   - Color: fill or stroke
   - Z-order: The first tag in svg is rendered first and overlapped in order.
