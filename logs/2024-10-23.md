I've been thinking about how to use both my custom classes and JavaFX classes. But it's not sure at the moment whether I can use my custom types without depending on the JavaFX instances, as both drawing and event handling are actually handled in JavaFX rather than my types.
1) If I include JavaFX object as a field in my type, it is no longer independent from JavaFX package. Is it okay?
2) Event handling flow is weird: Generate an event from FX, deliver it to the controller, then delegate the actual work again to the FX. It is because the window itself belongs to the FX.
3) Even if I use adapters for each shapes, I have to somehow match the FX objects that generated an event and the correspoding custom type shape object. To delete or sth. It seems two are closely related no matter how.

So maybe JavaFX is not the right choice?
